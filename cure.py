 - Surgery: The primary treatment involves surgically removing the tumor, often followed by additional treatments to ensure all cancerous cells are eradicated.
 - Radiation Therapy: High-energy beams are used to target and kill remaining tumor cells after surgery or as a standalone treatment when surgery is not feasible.
 - Chemotherapy: Utilizes drugs to destroy cancer cells or stop their growth, often used in conjunction with surgery and radiation.
 - Targeted Therapy: Focuses on specific genetic markers of cancer cells, providing a more personalized treatment approach.
 - Clinical Trials: Participation in experimental treatments and new therapies that are under investigation.
